Hello! X-GOVUK is an unofficial community-maintained space for people working on government digital services in the UK.

The "X" stands for "cross", as in "cross-government".

Collaboration across department and organisational boundaries within government is often very tricky, for all sorts of practical and cultural reasons.

But it can also be incredibly rewarding and save a lot of time, by sharing designs, code, and research findings.

The "X" also stands for "experimental", as this can be a space for ideas that aren't yet proven.

Projects include:

* a [template for writing design histories](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-design-history)
* a [crowdsourced list of UK government digital services](https://govuk-digital-services.herokuapp.com)
* an [extension for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit to enable forking questions based on radios](https://github.com/x-govuk/prototype-navigation-radios)
* a [wizard tool](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-prototype-wizard) for building and iterating ’one thing per page’ user journeys in prototypes

The [X-GOVUK](/) homepage also contains a list of useful design, content, prototyping and front-end resources from across government.

You can contribute links by opening a Pull Request on the [GitHub source](https://github.com/x-govuk/x-govuk.github.io) for this website – or by reaching out to any of us on the [cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/).
