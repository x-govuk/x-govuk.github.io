Hello! X-GOVUK is an unofficial community-maintained space for people working on government digital services in the UK.

The "X" stands for "cross", as in "cross-government".

Collaboration across department and organisational boundaries within government is often very tricky, for all sorts of practical and cultural reasons.

But it can also be incredibly rewarding and save a lot of time, by sharing designs, code, and research findings.

The "X" also stands for "experimental", as this can be a space for ideas that aren't yet proven.

The [X-GOVUK](/) homepage contains a list of useful design, content, prototyping and front-end resources.

You can contribute by opening a Pull Request on the [GitHub source](https://github.com/x-govuk/x-govuk.github.io) for this website â€“ or by reaching out to any of us on the x-gov Slack.
