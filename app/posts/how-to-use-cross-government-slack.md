[Cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/) is a Slack workspace for anyone working in central government, with channels on a range of topics. It's a place to connect with other people working on digital services across government.

## A bit of history

The cross-government Slack was created by the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) (GDS) in 2015 as a way for GDS to collaborate with other public sector digital service teams.

Over time, the workspace naturally grew and became a place to share knowledge on all things about digital, data and technology in the public sector.

The workspace is overseen by the [Central Digital & Data Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office).

## Why should you use it?

There's tons of reasons to use cross-government Slack. Here's a list of what I've found useful, but there's probably parts of the workspace I haven't made use of yet!

- Network with other people in similar roles, for sharing techniques and tools
- Find out about new programmes of work or job vacancies
- Learn from other teams on how they approach accessibility
- Discuss and share examples of applying the GOV.UK Design System to your service
- Get help and support using GOV.UK Pay and GOV.UK Notify
- Find meeting rooms in other government buildings
- Keep up with what other people are working on in the [#weeknotes](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/archives/CE2K1LU3Y) channel

The cool thing about cross-government Slack is that no question is too silly, and there are always kind people around who are willing to help you out. It's an open, inviting community and questions are usually answered quite quickly. I was involved in a workshop looking at the benefits of cross-government Slack recently, and other people who were part of the session said the same. They mentioned shared problem-solving, learning about agile and delivery management, and collaboration as examples of how using cross-government Slack had impacted their day-to-day work positively.

## Be careful what you say

Like all digital communication channels used by public servants, the cross-government Slack workspace is subject to Freedom of Information regulation. All messages, both public and private, group or direct, could be requested, reviewed and released. If you're in doubt about whether you can say something or talk about it, check the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) or ask for help in the [#ask-an-admin](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/archives/C039WM501EK) channel.

## How to join

The workspace is open to anyone working in government with a `.gov.uk` email address, and other qualified public sector organisations. If you're a contractor or commercial supplier working with a public sector organisation, you will need to ask for a `.gov.uk` address (or other qualified public sector email address) before you can join this Slack workspace.

A number of public sector email domains are able to sign-up without being invited, so check out the [list of allowed email domains](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/signup#/domain-signup).

For public sector organisations not on the email domain list, they can be invited by any existing Slack workspace member.
