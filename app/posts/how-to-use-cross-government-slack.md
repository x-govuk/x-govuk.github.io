[Cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/) is a Slack workspace for anyone working in central government, with channels on a range of topics. It's a place to connect with other people working on digital services across government.

## How to join

The workspace is open to anyone working in central government with a `.gov.uk` email address. If you're a contracter or agency working with a central government organisation, you may need to ask for a `.gov.uk` address to join the Slack.
